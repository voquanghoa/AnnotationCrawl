    <h2>Solar System</h2>
    <p class="description">The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system of the planets and the Sun plus other objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly.[b] Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c] with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[d]</p>
